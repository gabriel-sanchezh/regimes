Moreover, it seems to be that money growth and the rate of increase in prices move together over long periods of time[^gls], being the excessive money growth over output growth one of the most adopted thesis on the causes of inflation in the long run. The first monetary policy variable I use, which are denoted by `MP` in Table [2](tab-variables), is money supply in the form of a three-year change. In the same way, modern central banks raise the official (nominal) interest rate when high inflation affect the economy. In this manner, I assume a Neo-Fisherianism viewpoint, in which the real interest rate is independent of monetary factors, and so the nominal interest rates and inflation move in the same direction, and MPRs are used as instruments to affect the price levels.\n",

The first indicator is important due to the strong economic relationships between Latin American countries and the US, and because the 2020-2022 period was characterized by worldwide increases in prices. The national exchange rate to $\\$1$ is implemented based on pass-through theory, which argues that a country's rate of inflation is more robustly affected by exchange rate fluctuations when the country widely depends on imports."

In contrast, cost-push theory `(CP)` proposes that rises in the cost of production commodities impulse inflation rates, hence the Producer Price Index is included. Finally, inflation expectations `(IE)` fit in the analysis in behalf of the Rational Expectations revolution of 1970s, which recognises that economic agents generate expectations based on past and current information, and take into account these expectations when making their decisions."

    "Subsequently, an attribution methodology based on the Mahalanobis distance will be used to examine the influence of the variables that were presented before. The Mahalanobis distance[^mahalanobis] is a measure of divergence between groups in terms of multiple characteristics[^mclachlan]. Another way to introduce it is with variability: due to the positive or negative relation that multivariate data could show, the Mahalanobis approach assigns a larger distance to those observations that are not only further away from their means, as Euclidean distances would do, but to points from the sample that show a larger variability. The application used in this paper is based on {cite}`kinlaw2022`, in which the authors compute this distance to analyse inflationary regimes in the United States.
